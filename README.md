keepisisopen
============

This is a bookmarklet that will stop isis from prompting you to keep it open every 3 seconds!

Drag this --> [Keep Isis Open!](javascript:(function(\){ window.confirm=function(a\){return true;}; }\)(\);)

to your favorites bar. Then on Isis, hit the bookmark. No more Confirmation windows!

Todos/Notes
---------

I wouldn't use this if I was actively using isis to change classes and stuff, since this will automaticly accept all prompts which is a bad thing if you are doing sensitive work

If you navigate to a different page on isis then you will need to press the bookmark again

Don't worry about pressing it multiple times. It won't break anything. 

If you want to disable it, just refresh the page
